Magic Label™ is the pre-printed QR code label sticker that the URL is linking to a <b>web application</b> as follows:

- At the first scan, you can set the URL to jump.
- At the second scan or later, you will see the URL you've set above.

You can see the mechanism of the Magic Label™ as [How it works](how-it-works).  
You can refer to how to use it as - [Basic-usage](basic-usage).  
  
Because the Magic Label™ is a <b>web application</b>, unlike ordinary QR codes, the Magic Label™ expires after a certain time after setting the URL. Even if it has expired, for a certain period, in case of necessary to scan, it is possible to restart and extend expiration as a prime service. For more details, refer to the section - [Expiration](expiration).

## First Use
When you first read a new Magic Label™, the following screen will open.

As you can see here, there are two options.

1. **Register this as the owner.** If you need to change the URL later, press the go site button and select this by press **GO SITE** button near the center of the screen. 
After the owner registration, you can change the linked web address of it at the [Magic Label™](https://magiclabel.uedasoft.com/) site with your account.
Please see [here](register-as-the-owner) for the detail.

2. **Use instantly.** 
If you do not need to change the web address once registered, you can register the web address directly using the lower half of the screen. 
Enter the web address, which you would link to this, in the "URL" text area at the bottom of the screen and press the blue cloud-shaped floating action button, then the URL will be registered as the link destination URL.
Please see [here](register-url) for the detail.

# Expiration

Because the Magic Label™ is a <b>web application</b>, unlike ordinary QR codes which don't require network bandwidth or server resouces, the Magic Label™ requires the cost of network bandwidth and server resouces for running the system. I ask you for your understanding that I can't pay the necessary cost to provide forever capability of scanning it.   


after a certain time after setting the URL. Even if it has expired, for a certain period, in case of necessary to scan, it is possible to restart and extend expiration as a prime service.

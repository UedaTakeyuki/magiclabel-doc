# Expiration

Because the Magic Label™ is a <b>web application</b>, unlike ordinary QR codes which don't require network bandwidth or server resources, the Magic Label™ requires the cost of network bandwidth and server resources for running the system. I ask you for your understanding that I can't pay the necessary cost to provide forever capability of scanning it.   

The Magic Label™ expires 1 year after setting the URL. Even after expired, when you scan it you will see that this Magic Label™ has been expired and you can extend expiration as a prime service for a certain period. This period is still not decided. I will announce it as soon as it is decided.  
The price for a 1-year extension of the expiration is **1$**.
